🛍️ ShopEZ – One-Stop Shop for Online Purchases

The project titled "ShopEZ – One-Stop Shop for Online Purchases" aims to empower local shopkeepers by providing a digital platform to showcase and sell their products online. The system allows sellers to register, manage their products and orders, while customers can browse, search, and securely purchase items. Admins monitor all platform activities.
ShopEZ helps bridge the gap between offline small businesses and the digital marketplace by eliminating the need for high-cost third-party platforms and complex technologies.
